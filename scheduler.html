 <div class="project-description">
    <p>
      As a student, one of my biggest struggles is managing all the work I have to do in different classes. 
      I was looking through the app store for the perfect planner app, but none of them were what I was picturing. 
      So, I decided to build my own scheduler program in OCaml with two other students.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started by thinking about my perspective as a user. I began brainstorming everything I would want 
      in a productivity application, and sketched out my ideas.
    </p>

    <div class="brainstorm-sketch">
      <img src="{{ '/assets/files/schedulerideas.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Brainstorm Sketches">
    </div>

    <p>
      I drew up an interface of what my app would look like in an ideal world, just for fun. 
      At the basic level, the interface is simple. You can add tasks, and view your tasks list. 
    </p>

    <div class="scheduler-ui">
      <img src="{{ '/assets/files/scheduler-concept-glossy.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Fancy UI">
    </div>

    <p>
      Once there was a task list, ideally the program could help the user determine which order to complete their tasks in. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As I continued imagining my product, I added more features to fit my needs as a student. 
      As a member of a project team, we often have a bunch of tasks that we need to delegate to different members. 
      These tasks have to be assigned fairly, while respecting pre-existing time commitments. 
      The next feature I decided to add was a task assignment feature for teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue I face working with my project team is that everyone has busy schedules, 
      so it can be hard to find times to meet. I decided to add a feature that finds a set of 
      potential meeting times for a group of people. 
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, I decided to add a feature for events as well. 
      Students often have to manage their time to complete their assignments and also attend 
      things like office hours and review sessions. These events have a clear start and end time 
      unlike tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within my group, I took on the responsibility of planning the overall structure of our project. 
      I broke down the big picture idea into the features available to the user, which determined 
      the modules we would need to create, and their interfaces. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To start, our user interface would be the command line. I would allow for the user to enter 
      different modes corresponding to the different functionalities described above. 
      Formally, I specified three modes: Task Scheduler, Event Scheduler, and Groups, 
      along with an initial state the user would start in.
    </p>

    <div class="scheduler-interface">
      <img src="{{ '/assets/files/scheduler-interface.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Interface">
    </div>

    <p>
      At this stage of planning, I determined all of the different commands tentatively available 
      to the user. This established how they could switch between different modes, and use the 
      different features within each mode.
    </p>

    <div class="scheduler-fsm">
      <img src="{{ '/assets/files/scheduler-fsm.png' | relative_url }}" alt="FSM">
    </div>

    <p>
      At this point, once I developed specifications for each of the modules, I could 
      split the work with my team members and begin implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be continued...
